excerpt: "My name is Pavlo Plotko. I’m the Scientific Coordinator at the Deutsches Zentrum für Astroteilchenphysik (DZA), where I oversee scientific collaborations across Eastern Europe. I did a PhD at DESY in September 2020, focusing on self-consistent modeling of ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) propagation from sources such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). Outside of my core responsibilities at DZA, I remain deeply involved in Ukrainian outreach efforts together with both DESY and DZA. Photo by DESY, Science Communication Lab."

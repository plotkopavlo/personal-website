excerpt: "Hello! My name is Pavlo Plotko and I'm a PhD student DESY since September 2020. My current focus is on self-consistent modeling of propagation UHECRs from sources such as AGNs and TDE. Outside of my research, I'm actively involved in numerous Ukrainian outreach projects together with DESY. Photo by DESY, Science Communication Lab."

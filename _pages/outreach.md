## Young Scientists’ Conference on Astronomy and Space Physics (Ukraine)
The premier international conference in Ukraine for bachelor, master, PhD students, and young postdocs. Unique to this conference is that its Local Organizing Committee (LOC) consists solely of students. My first engagement with this conference was in 2013 when I presented a poster. The following year, I joined the LOC, while in my first year of my Bachelor. By 2018, I had become the secretary of the conference, and by 2021, I was named the chairman of the "High-Energy Astrophysics" section.

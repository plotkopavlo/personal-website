Hello! I'm Pavlo Plotko. Since September 2020, I've been a PhD student with the Astroparticle Theory Group at DESY. I hail from Kharkiv, located in eastern Ukraine. Influenced by my mother, a teacher, I delved into computers and physics early on, writing my first code at just 9 years old. During high school, I actively participated in scientific Olympiads and tournaments. My interest in Astronomy was solidified in 2012 when I conducted a photometric observation of asteroid 4 Vesta. This experience steered me towards pursuing both a Bachelor's and a Master's in Astronomy in Kyiv. Right from my first year, I was hands-on with scientific projects, and I took the initiative to organize conferences and meetups. My research focused on the non-thermal emission from SNRs and PWNs. After completing my degrees in 2020, I embarked on my journey with DESY.

My current focus is on self-consistent modeling of propagation UHECRs from sources such as AGNs and TDEs. 

Outside of my research, I'm actively involved in numerous Ukrainian outreach projects and initiatives aimed at enhancing student life at DESY. Additionally, I have a keen interest in physiology and bouldering.
